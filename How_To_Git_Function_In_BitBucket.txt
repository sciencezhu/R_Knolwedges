git branch      --  Show all branches under local and which branch you are in (a star at the begining of the branch name).

git status      --  Show the status of the current selected branch

git checkout  branch_name    -- this will goes to the "branch_name" branch

git merge Another_Branch_name  -- this will merge from the Another_Branch_name into your current activated branch "branch_name".


git push -u Base_Branch_Name Branch_Name   -- this will push from local to remote.

git commit -m"comments"  -- this will commit the changes with the "comments"


When we made changes on the dev branches, we can locally merge them into the Production branch, and then push the two branches into remote, one by one, respectively.
